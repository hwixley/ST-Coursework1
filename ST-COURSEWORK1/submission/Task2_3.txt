Advantages of using automated test generation tools:
- They are fast to do as all you have to do is execute the program
- Easy way to confirm the application still functions properly
- Allows testing professionals more time to write more complex test cases that the auto-generator does not catch

Disadvantages of using automated test generation tools:
- Not reliable as they typically cannot find many bugs
- Can provide a false sense of security
- Still requires testing professionals to go over the bugs found in auto-generated test cases as to not write redundant test cases
