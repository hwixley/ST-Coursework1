Advantages of using automated test generation tools:
- They are fast and easy to implement as all you have to do is execute the test generation tool on the application
- They provide quick feedback and are useful to check that the application still functions properly after changes are made to it
- Allows testing professionals more time to write more complex test cases that the auto-generator does not catch

Disadvantages of using automated test generation tools:
- Not reliable as they typically cannot find many bugs
- Can provide a false sense of security
- Still requires testing professionals to go through all the auto-generated test cases so they do not write redundant tests
